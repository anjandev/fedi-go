# fedi-go

A non-electron fediverse client.

Still in active development. This is my first project using go, qt, and the mastodon api. High level code improvement reccomendations are welcome.

## Support

The "real" git repository is here: [https://git.sr.ht/~anjan/fedi-go](https://git.sr.ht/~anjan/fedi-go)
The github repository is merely a mirror.

I like using sr.ht over github because it's decentralized (like the fediverse itself).
To learn more about why sr.ht is good, see:

### Pull Requests

I would reccomend that you use git-email to send patchs for fedi-go.
See: https://man.sr.ht/git.sr.ht/send-email.md

However, I understand this may not be for everyone and I will accept Pull Requests on Github.

### Feature requests, bugs, and discussion

Issue tracker: [https://todo.sr.ht/%7Eanjan/fedi-go](https://todo.sr.ht/%7Eanjan/fedi-go)
Please make an account on sr.ht and request features, bugs, etc here.

If you do not want to make an account on sr.ht you can send an email to the fedi-go mailing-list and I will gladly copy the issue over to the bug tracker.

## Operating System Support
Currently, I am only support linux builds. As the code is more tested and can do more, I plan to support windows and *bsd.
MacOS will likely never be supported by me as I would have to buy a mac to compile for the mac.
I may need someone who has a mac to compile the software for me.

- GNU/Linux
